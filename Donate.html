  <h1> Why Donate? </h1>
  
  <p>Donate to our furry little companions so you can help begin their journey to finding their forever home.  You’ll be giving them the second chance they deserve. Each dog on this list needs your contribution, big or small for a variety of required extensive veterinary expenses (including, but not limited to), de-sexing, micro-chipping and vaccinating. You'll also cover expenses for food, bedding, parasite prevention, collars, leads, ID tags, toys and other on-going canine maintenance costs. Please help our vulnerable little friends find safety and comfort within their lives. You can choose which dog would like to support and how much you would like to contribute. </p>
